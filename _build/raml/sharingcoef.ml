(* Input:  two lists of index-constructor pairs ((index * constr_id) list)
   Output: a list of all possible interleavings where two indices can
           be at identical positions if constructors match.  It is handy to
           distinguish the the origin of the indices by using pairs where
           Iunit means empty.

   Example:
     interleave [1, c; 2, d] [3, c; 4, d] =
       [ [( 1, *, c); ( 2, *, d); ( *, 3, c); ( *, 4, d)]

       ; [( *, 3, c); ( 1, *, c); ( 2, *, d); ( *, 4, d)]
       ; [( *, 3, c); ( 1, *, c); ( *, 4, d); ( 2, *, d)]

(* Input: Two indices i, j
   Output: A map k -> c^(i,j)_k where c^(i,j)_k are positive integers such that
           p_i * p_j = sum_k c^(i,j)_k p_k

   sharing_coefficient should be called with indices of the same type only.
   It is handy to allow one argument to be Iunit regardless of the other
   argument.  The sharingCoeffs are then 1, which is equal to p_*.

   Implementation detail: sharing_coefficient' returns
   [ `Array_result Array.t | `Map_result Ind_map.t ] to minimize conversion
   costs.  One should always use sharing_coefficient_array and
   sharing_coefficient_map that handle the conversion when the caller requires
   a different kind of representation that the most effecient computation
   yields.  The exported function sharing_coefficient is equivalent to
   sharing_coefficient_map.

         2. for each interleaving, each element xys[s] correspond to xs[l],
            ys[r], or both (essentially xs[l] * ys[r]), use sharing_coefficient
            to figure out the k |-> c^(xs[l], ys[r])_k mapping, or xs[l] |-> 1
            or ys[r] |-> 1 for the former two cases (List.map xys ...);

            by selecting one from each index s (cartisian_product);

         5. insert all the Ind ks |-> c into an index map with the coefficients
            of the same key summed.

1) Strings and integers

Strings and integers are currently not supported. Please use integer
lists and natural numbers (see raml_runtime/rnat.ml).

2) Built-in equality

Built-in equality is only supported for ground types such as integer,
bool and float. Therefore is not possible to use equality in a
polymorphic function. Fix: Add type annotations or make equality a
function parameter.

5) Exceptions

Exceptions are currently (version 1.3) broken for the constant
resource usage and lower bound analysis and programs.
